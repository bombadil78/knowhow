POSTGRES 101

General
- Both databases and schemas are collections of objects like tables, data types, functions or operators
- Databases cannot share objects among users
- Schemas can share objects among users
- Users can access the database cluster using different authentication methods; in Postgres users and roles are synonyms
- A privilege is a right that can be granted to a user for an object, e.g. database; the privilege can also be revoked. Possible privileges are: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE, ...
- Any object can have an owner; in the context of a database the owner gets all privileges by default. Any other access is controlled using privileges

Authentication
Postgres uses a configuration to allow access to the database cluster. The access rights are defined in a rule table. Once an access matches a row in the table the rule is evaluated. Access is granted if the rule evaluates to true, otherwise access is denied. No further rules are evaluated.

A rule consists of the following properties
- Type: E.g. local for access from a Unix domain-sockets or host for TCP/IP connections
- Database: Databases that are accessed
- User: Database user that wants to authenticate
- Address: IP-address patterns 
- Method: E.g. peer to rely on OS, md5 for password authentication

On Ubuntu Linux the configuration file is located at /etc/postgresql/<some-version>/main/pg_hba.conf

Database management

There are command-line tools that facilitate the interaction with the database cluster:
- createdb <db-name>: Creates a new database
- dropdb <db-name>: Drops an existing database
- pg_dump or pg_dump <db-name>: Dumps a database cluster or a selected database
- createuser <user-name>: Creates a new user
- createuser <user-name> -P: Creates a new user and asks for the inital password
- dropuser <user-name>: Drops an existing user

Privileges
A superuser or the owner of an object can manage privileges to a object for another user using GRANT and REVOKE.
